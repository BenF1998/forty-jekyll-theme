<h2>Preprint- Technical Note: Uncovering the influence of methodological variations on the extractability of iron bound organic carbon </h2>
<h3>Ben J. Fisher, Johan C. Faust, Oliver W. Moore, Caroline L. Peacock, and Christian MÃ¤rz</h3>
<h4>Friday 6th November 2020</h4>

Our new preprint is now available for <a href="https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2020-399/">open disucssion and comment</a> in EGU Biogeosciences. This paper came from the method evalution section of my masters thesis while at the University of Leeds. 
Here we evaluted different versions of the same method for extracting iron bound organic carbon. These methods have differed over the past 70 years as people have tried to extract this type of carbon from different media, incluidng soils, sediments, clays, cryocronite, plants to name but a few!
We aimed to develop a single established protcol which would allow for the production of comparative results, one issue with the current multiple versions of this method is that comparisons can't be made between different groups using slightly different versions of the iron bound organic carbon extraction. 
This has made modelling the carbon cycle particuarly difficult as it is hard to develop a global consensus on carbon presence and persistance without a collaborative empirical data set. 

In conclusion we found that the treatment of a sample prior to analysis and the strength of sodium dithionite used in the extraction were key determinants for method efficency with a strong ability to influence the final extraction values. Other factors such as time and tempreature were less important. 
Finally we cross calibrated these findings between a synthetic and natural (Arctic) marine sample to determine whether a model sediment behaved chemically in the same way as real marine sediments.

The discussion window is open until December 18th, anyone can comment on the paper in that time so feel free to add your thoughts.
