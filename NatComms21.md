Abstract </h4>
Our new study, published in <i> Nature Communications </i> shows for the first time that iron bound organic carbon persists for thousands of years in marine sediments, 
giving a sense of scale to the preservation of organic carbon in the "rusty sink". Additionally, we found that <i> in situ </i> coprecipitation at the sediment-seawater interface
could not be responsbile for all OC-Fe binding with 10% of this fraction occuring above the iron redox zone in sediments. We conclude that a significant fraction of OC-Fe in sedimnets
was likely formed on land before sequestration into sediments. In agreement with previous studies, we suggest that the stability of the OC-Fe sink is stable with both changes in climate (Faust et al., 2020) 
and diaganetic chnages in the sediment profile (this study). Therefore iron-bound organic carbon is likely to remain an important sink for OC into the future.
