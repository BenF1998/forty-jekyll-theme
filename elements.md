<p>This page contains my current and past research projects. In addition to these I have research interests in a wide range of areas, incluidng: geomicrobiology, organic geochemistry, astrobiogeochemistry, ice-ocean interactions and wider cryosphere processes. I'm always keen to get involved in new collaborations, if you are interested in working with me then please get in touch!</p>
<h2>PhD- The influence of climate driven changes in ocean productivity on carbon and nitrogen uptake on the West Antarctic Peninsula.&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Supervised by:&nbsp;Dr Sian Henley (Edinburgh), Dr Alex Poulton (Herriot-Watt), Prof Keith Davidson (SAMS), Prof Mike Meredith (BAS). From 2020-2024</h4>
<p>The Southern Ocean is undergoing rapid change due to its vulnerability to climate warming. Melting ice, sea surface tempreature, nutrient bioavailability, ocean pH and salinity all effect primary producitivty by phytoplankton in the surface ocean. Phytoplankton are responsible for providing the energy for the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and exerts a control on primary producitivty globally by influencing the nutrient profile of the global thermocline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this project I am developing a seasonal scale time series for phytoplankton community compositon and biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen and important macronutrients on the West Antarctic Peninusla. We aim to associate phytoplankton community dynamics with biogeochemical cycling and understand how phytoplankton adapt to physical climate change through the different seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project utilises many multidisciplinary tools and data sets to achieve this, bringing together phyiscal oceanography to understand the underlying currents with isotopic tracers to monitor the uptake of carbon and nitrogen. Nutrient profiles are determined using high throughput nitrate, nitrie, phopshate and silicilic acid methods and phytoplankton communities are assessed by microscopy and density.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To facilitate this I am grateful for funding recieved from NERC and SAGES, in addition to logistical and technical support from The University of Edinburgh, The Scottish Association for Marine Science and The British Antarctic Survey.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MScR-&nbsp;An experimental approach to understand the role of iron bound carbon for organic matter preservation in marine sediments.&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Supervised by Dr Christian M<strong>&auml;rz, Dr Johan Faust, Dr Oliver Moore and Prof Caroline Peacock (University of Leeds). From 2019-2020</strong></h4>
<p>In this project I investigated the role of carboxyl groups in a preservative sorption mechanism of organic carbon to reactive iron phases in marine sediments. This involved using an experimental approach to synthesise organic-ferrihydrite compounds with known carbon and iron contents. A chemical extraction technique (CBD) was then applied to these samples in order to better understand the specificity of this extraction technique for quantifying the iron bound carbon pool. From this study we were able to quantify uncertainties in techniques used to quantify preserved organic carbon on a global scale and suggest improvements to reduce these uncertainties.</p>
